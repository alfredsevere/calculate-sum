# calculate-sum
In this code, we define a function called calculate_sum that takes a list of numbers as input. The function iterates over each number in the list and adds it to the total variable. Finally, it returns the calculated sum. We then test the function by passing a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and printing the result.
